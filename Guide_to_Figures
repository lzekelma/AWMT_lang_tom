This repository contains the code to create figures for the paper "White Matter Association Tracts Underlying Language and Theory of Mind: 
An investigation of 809 Brains from the Human Connectome Project".

Figure 1 - Histogram of TPVT and PERT Scores
this figure was created using code from paper_stats file. lines 51-56.

Figure 2 - 20 WM Association Tracts
the tracts were colored using create_mrml_based_excel_colors.py and visualized using slicer
 
Table 1 - Summary of Regression Models
age_gen.R was used to create each model. the data produced from this code was saved in the uncorrected.xlsx. the uncorrected csv is then used as input frd_correction.R which outputs corrected.xlsx. 

Figure 3 - Visualizations by p-value and beta
p-values and beta values from table 1 were used to create this visualization.  the p-values were visualized using create_mrml_based_excel_fdr.py and create_mrml_based_excel_betas. 

Figure 4 - Effect Plots
effect plots are generated towards the end of the age_gen.R

Supplementary Figure 1 - Handedness Histogram
this figure is generated in paper_stats, line 48

Supplementary Figure 2 - Superior and Anterior Views
this figure was visualized in Slicer. the mrml files are the same as those used in figure 2.

Supplementary Figure 3 - Laterality Indices
laterality_indices_plots.R was used to create this figure.
